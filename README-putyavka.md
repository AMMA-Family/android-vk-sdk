API methods with user vialidation (such as 'apps.sendRequest') are not working so far in any version SDK >2.0
VKWebViewAuthActivity crashes. I hope this fix will help.
Please, add extra example with 'apps.sendRequest'
Also it was not mentioned that VK.initialize() must be called to make VKWebViewAuthActivity to be run at all
